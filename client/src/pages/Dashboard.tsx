- I should see all of the schedules for my user for the day of the week it is (for example, if it is Monday then I should only see the schedules that have me doing something on Monday.)
- I should see a list of all my reptiles
- When selecting a reptile the app should navigate to the Reptile page
- I should be able to create a new reptile (you can do this on this page via something like a pop up, or you can create a new page for this)
- I should be able to delete a reptile.
- I should be able to log out of my account
